In this project, the binary search tree used for storing challenges has an average insertion time of O(log n) 
because each insert cuts the possible location in half as you move down the tree. In the worst case, if the tree becomes unbalanced, it can take
 O(n) time. The breadth-first search algorithm used to check for a path between rooms has a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of rooms and E is the number of paths. This is because breadth-first search visits every room and connection once. The hero's inventory uses a queue where adding or removing items takes O(1) constant time, since queues operate from the front and back without needing to search through all elements.
